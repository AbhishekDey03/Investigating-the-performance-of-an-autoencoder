# Investigating the outperformance of an AE for compression tasks

It is seen throughout literature and in practise that probabilistic models like the VAE and the VQ-VAE are outperformed by the basic autoencoder in purely compression tasks. This repository will contain my heuristic work to investigate this. Information:

1. This is done with the RGZ108k dataset. This is the dataset my Master's project uses. [https://github.com/inigoval/byol]
